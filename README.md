# connected-esp32-speakers
IOT INSA Project. We need to make interconnected speakers with some ESP32 connected to a locally hosted MQTT Server.

A phone or a BLE tag is used as a source power by the ESP32 which can detect the signal strenght. Depending on the signal, play the music to the appropriate speaker.
